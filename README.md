## Why?
This project is actually a school project. Our objective is to make a bot able to make the maximum of money from some data. Data comes from "https://finnhub.io/docs/api/stock-candles". It is not intended for use on real markets nor anything like that don't try to make money out of it you risk losing it all.

## Versions
0.0: In development (not working) (actual version)

## How to install and use it?
For this section, we will assume that you know how to use a computer but know nothing about programming. If you need any help, [contact us](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO#contact-us).

First, you're gonna need python. Download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During python's installations you will have a checkbox for if you want to asked Python to PATH. Do it. Then you will be asked if you want to disable PATH length limit. Do it.<br>
Congratulations! You now have Python!

Next step is to install the parent project. Download our [teacher's repository](https://github.com/benjaminforest/beagleboys). Once you are on the website click the green "Code" button then "Download ZIP". Extract it anywhere you want. For those of you who understand this file you might think it's a little to much just to launch an object but it was designed to make a bunch of bots like ours compete. The problem is that even with these files some edits will be needed. If you have your own app to edit them then you're on your own. If not, download notepad++ from [their website](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) then right click on the files you need to edit and click "Edit with notepad++". The changes you will have to make are the following:
- Add `input()` at the end of the main.py file<br>
Congratulations! You now have the parent project!

The final step is to install the child project. First download it as ZIP like you did for the last one from [this link](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO) (wich might be the link you're actually on). Then extract it into the parent project's folder. You should now have a new folder into the parent folder.<br>
Congratulations! You just finished the installation!

Now, to use it, you will only need to double-click the "main.py" file in the parent project's directory.
